                    Thank you for your interest in joining my lab at UCSC! <font color="darkred">There are multiple PhD positions starting in Fall 2021 (and at least one every year after) in my lab</font>. I have compiled some freqently asked questions for students who are interested in working with me. Please read the following information before contacting me. Due to time constraints, I might not be able to reply to your email. Thanks.
                </p>

<h3>Instructions of contacting me for prospective students and visitors</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <font color="darkred">Prospective PhD students who are not currently at UCSC</font>: please read the <a href="https://grad.soe.ucsc.edu/cse">official graduate student admission policy of the UCSC CSE Department</a> for general departmental requirements. When you apply, you may list me as a potential advisor in your application and personal statement. There is no need to contact me, unless you have a particular research question/idea that you would like to discuss further. If you email me, please describe the research question concretely, and include your CV, transcript, and your representative publication (if any).
    </li>
    <li>
        <font color="darkred">Prospective visiting students</font>: I typically do not accept unsolicited applications for visiting students, interns, or scholars. The only exception is that you can demonstrate your expertise in my research area (typically via strong publications) <b>and</b> have sufficient funding to support yourself for a year.
    </li>
    <li>
        <font color="darkred">Current UCSC students</font>: please email me directly with your CV and transcript. For MS students and undergraduates, the minimum time commitment is 20 hours per week for six months.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>My research interests</h3>
My research interests include Natural Language Processing (natural language grounding, knowledge-based reasoning, multilingual understanding), Computer Vision (vision and language, visual navigation and robotics, activity understanding), and Machine Learning (deep learning, self-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, multimodal machine learning), with an emphasis on building embodied AI agents that can communicate with humans using natural language to perform real-world tasks. You may want to read my <a href="./research_statement.pdf">research statement</a> to get a better idea (though it might be slightly dated).


<h3>Why UCSC</h3>
UC Santa Cruz is one of America's Public Ivy universities and a member of the prestigious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_American_Universities">Association of American Universities (AAU)</a>. In 2018, Times Higher Education rated UC Santa Cruz 3rd in the world for research influence, tied with Stanford University. UCSC PhD graduates who chose to join academia have taken tenure-track positions at top schools such as UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, MIT, JHU, UNC, WUSTL.
UCSC CSE is ranked No. 43 (next to Yale, Boston, Brown, JHU, etc.) on <a href="http://csrankings.org/#/index?all">csrankings.org</a>, the most objective CS rankings based on top conference publications. UCSC CSE is rising very rapidly, for instance, four new faculty (including me) are joining UCSC CSE in this upcoming academic year, which hasn't been included for calculating the CS rankings. The department has many leading researchers in the broad area of AI, data science, and systems: Lise Getoor, Marilyn Walker, Manfred Warmuth, Darral Long, Yi Zhang, James Davis, Roberto Manduchi, Luca de Alfaro, Chen Qian, Yang Liu, Peter Alvaro, ... just to name a few. <br>

Location wise, UCSC's proximity to Silicon Valley (around 30-min driving) and <a href="https://siliconvalley.ucsc.edu/">satellite campus there</a>, make industrial collaborations, startups, exchange of ideas, and internships very easy. UCSC has one of the most beautiful and unique campuses in the world (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogGSFZUjrwE">YouTube video</a> | <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1xz411e77n?from=search&seid=1387866364580672367">bilibili video</a>) and perfect weather year-round. Santa Cruz is also a wonderful place for outdoor activities such as hiking, surfing, diving, kayaking, and golfing.


<h3>What I expect from you</h3>
I have four primary requirements for my PhD students. 

First of all, <font color="darkred">self-motivated</font>: students must be curious about research and self-motivated to overcome obstacles when researching new findings.

Second, students need to be <font color="darkred">mathematically mature</font> (i.e., proficient and comfortable with probability theory, statistics, linear algebra, optimization, and calculus). One way to test yourself is to carefully go through some of the best ML papers published at recent ICML/NIPS/AAAI/IJCAI conferences, and see if you can fully understand the main equations in those papers. 

Third, I require my students to be <font color="darkred">proficient in programming</font>: they should have expertise in one or more programming languages such as Python, C, C++, Java. The ability of prototyping ideas quickly is often a big plus.  

Last and probably the most important: <font color="darkred">hard-working and reliable</font>. No matter how smart you are and what fields you are in, if you don't spend enough time on your work, there is no way you can be an expert. An observation from the most successful PhD students is that they are all reliable and work extremely hard. In summary, if you are a hard-working, reliable person who is passionate about advancing AI and solid in Math and programming, please consider applying to UCSC.

<h3>What I can offer to you</h3>
<ul>
    <li> 
        Full financial support including complete tuition waiver, monthly stipend, and summer salary.
    </li>
    <li> 
        World-class research environment comprising innovative research ideas for top-tier conferences (e.g., ACL/EMNLP/NAACL, CVPR/ICCV/ECCV, and NeurIPS/AAAI/ICLR), and large-scale computational resources.
    </li>
    <li>
        First-hand research guidance from me during weekly 1-1 meetings, as well as a collabrative and friendly group environment where periodical social events will be organized to unit group members together.
    </li>
    <li>
        Potential internship opportunities in top research labs in the industry including (but not limited to) Google AI, Microsoft Research, Facebook AI Research, Adobe Research, Amazon, Nvidia etc. My personal contact (see <a href="./index.html#experience">my previous employment</a>) and UCSC's proximity to Silicon Valley make the industrial collaboration very easy.
    </li>
